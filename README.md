## Description
This is an app where the user can interact with an OpenAI powered career advice assistance named ReX. This is a beginner mission done during my internship with Radical AI with the aim of getting familiar with various tools.

## Tools Used
React, Node.js, Material UI, Framer Motion, Axios, Open AI

## Running Instructions
In terminal, 'npm start'. then click on the local host link.

## Acknowledgement
I would like to acknowledge the Radical AI Team for their tutorial videos, and Kyle P. for his help in troubleshooting any issues. As well, this video (https://youtu.be/Lag9Pj_33hM?feature=shared) helped me setup some features of the chat bot, specifically the OpenAI integration.

## Env Setup Information (for future reference)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
